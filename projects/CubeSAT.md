summary: CubeSAT for weather prediction developed with the Hawai'i Space Flight Laboratory
---
## Background
CubeSATS are small, rectangular-shaped satellites; they are most often used to conduct research in space. CubeSATS are usually launched as payloads on rockets or other launch vehicles and generally do not contain a propulsion mechanism of their own. The cost of developing, testing, and launching a CubeSAT can cost upwards of one-million dollars. 

Currently, there is little standardization in CubeSAT design and many CubeSAT developers rely on an already established flight heritage--concepts and designs they themselves (the institution) have built up over time--to develop new CubeSATs. The overall design of a CubeSAT is usually specialized to a specific science mission. 

## Ke'Ao Sattelite
The team working on the Ke-Ao sattelite consists of 10+ undergraduate members. Our team's primary goal is to create a functional, inexpensive satellite (under $10,000) for use in STEM education to Hawai'i's pre-K to High School students. Our CubeSat's science mission is to observe the weather over over Hawai'i. Our goal launch date is Fall 2020.

My role in the project involves working with the onboard computer and developing the flight software for the satellite. The flight software is an important part of the satellite as it is needed to control the transmission of data to and from the ground station, manage the satellite power, process payload data, and to orientate the satellite. 

Working with the onboard computer includes determining how the onboard computer will interface with other devices and how everything will physically come together. For our actual computer, we are using an iteration of a design previously used by HSFL. The board utilizes an ARM-Cortex processor

We are currently in the development phase of the satellite and working to secure additional funding.
