summary: A High-school Senior Research Project
---

## Background
As a graduation requirement, my highschool requires a senior project. This project begins during Junior year and consists of four elements:

1. 10 Research Logs regarding the topic of choice
2. A 10-page, double-spaced Research Paper
3. A 10-15 minute presentation on the topic
4. A Service project/Creative Endeavor/Applied learning related to the topic

My parents are both avid surfers and they taught me how to swim at a young age. Since then, I swam competitively until graduating high school; thus, the water has been a big part of my life. Because of this, I chose water safety for my senior project topic. This was the biggest project I had at the time and the project helped me develop my research and presentation skills as well as helping me land my first job.

## Experiences
As my applied learning, I enrolled into a lifeguard course and got my lifeguard and CPR certification. After receiving my certification, I began working at the Kaimuki YMCA as a lifeguard and swim instructor.

When working as a swim instructor, we had to call an ambulance for a student. This was because the mother was worried about a phenomenon known as delayed drowning.

## Delayed Drowning
After water is inhaled, swelling/inflammation can happen in the lungs. This can make it difficult for the body to absorb oxygen. When this happens, it is possible for a person to asphyxiate and die. Symptons include feeling lethargic, difficulty breathing, and coughing/vomitting; generally, death doesn't occur until many hours after water inhalation. 

One way to alleviate symptoms is to increase the flow of oxygen entering the body. This can be done with, for example, an oxygen tank. Cases of delayed drowning are rare and usually only happen after cases of near-drowning (lots of water entering airpipe). In most cases, a death could have been avoided by going to the hospital after experiencing the above symptoms.
