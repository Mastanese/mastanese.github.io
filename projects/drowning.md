summary: A High-school Senior Research Project
---

## Background
As a graduation requirement, my highschool requires a senior project. This project consists of four elements:

1. 10 Research Logs regarding the topic of choice
2. A 10-page, double-spaced Research Paper
3. A 10-15 minute presentation on the topic
4. A Service project/Creative Endeavor/Applied learning related to the topic

My parents are both avid surfers and they taught me how to swim at a young age. Since then, I swam competitively until graduating high school; thus, the water has been a big part of my life. Because of this, I chose water safety for my senior project topic.
