## UI Frameworks

UI frameworks provide tools to make it easier to design applications. One example of a UI framework is Semantic UI, which allows
the creation of responsive, modern-looking websites with minimal amounts of human-readable code. Other UI framworks include bootstrap,
React, Pure, and Ulkit. Overall, UI frameworks provide developers with powerful tools to use in everyday design.

One useful function of Semantic UI are containers and grids. Containers encapsulate other elements and can automatically set margins among other things. Within the container, a grid can help specify the placement of specific elements. For example, a grid can be used to center a button or add text columns to a page. Semantic UI can transform old-style html pages to modern websites without any major changes in the complexity of the code.

## Learning Semantic UI

Semantic UI is a framework used with HTML and CSS for developing web applications. Semantic UI elements are called through css classes.
Semantic classes can be used to align elements, modernize the look of an application, perform dynamic reformatting, and improve the
functionality of form items:

Personally, I struggle a little with using HTML, CSS, and Semantic UI. I find it hard keeping track of what encloses what and making things work the way I want always takes multiple iterations. Compared to simpler markup languages like LaTeX and Markdown, using HTML with these frameworks makes me feel frustrated; however, this frustration comes with learning anything new and is part of the process. Additionally, it is easy to see how Semantic UI can improve websites by leaps-and-bounds. UI Frameworks can provide powerful tools and it is beneficial to become experienced with them.
