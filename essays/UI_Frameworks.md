React, Pure, and Ulkit. Overall, UI frameworks provide developers with powerful tools to use in everyday design.

Personally, I struggle a little with using HTML, CSS, and Semantic UI. I find it hard keeping track of what encloses what and making things work the way I want always takes multiple iterations. Compared to simpler markup languages like LaTeX and Markdown, using HTML with these frameworks makes me feel frustrated; however, this frustration comes with learning anything new and is part of the process. Additionally, it is easy to see how Semantic UI can improve websites by leaps-and-bounds. UI Frameworks can provide powerful tools and it is beneficial to become experienced with them.
