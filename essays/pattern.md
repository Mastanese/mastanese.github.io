## Lava Flows
Both hardware and software design can be subject to "lava flows". Lava flows refer to portions of an implementation that have had their meanings lost or obfuscated. These portions often remain untouched by future project members and can build up over time. 

I have recently run into this problem in a project course. The main goal of this project was in modifying a PCB board which was meant to support a mini computer. This particular problem is not exactly a lava flow--the people who had created the board are still around, and there are others who have an understanding of the board. 

However, many of the creators are often busy and hard to contact. Additionally, much of the documentation is inaccessible or hidden away. The board is also complex and contains many components and wires. The project also requires a sufficient understanding of the board to assist other people working on the project. Often times, parts of the board are indecypherable to us and require someone with more knowledge than us to assist. 

Lava flows can cause delays and problems in projects. However, they are hard to avoid, especially in a constantly changing environment. Being experienced in design flows can alleviate this problem. Having more experience and knowledge of patterns can make understanding other's work easier and prevent or slow the growth of lava flows. Having established design patterns can make it easier to collaborate with others and make one more desirable to employers.
