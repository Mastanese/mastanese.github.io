## Open Source Software Development
I believe that learning new programming languages and frameworks makes it easier to learn other languages and frameworks. Foundations built when learning one language can be leaned on when learning another--Concepts of looping, if/else logic, encapsulation, scope, object-oriented program, etc are found in many programming languages. Similarly, frameworks containing meant for the same purpose will contain similar elements and ways of thinking. syntax is often reused or built upon across various programming structures. My first experience with JavaScript was through a free online course through CodeCademy. I was able to power through the majority of the lessons due to JavaScript having functionality and syntax similar to C++. In contrast, I learned Semantic-UI after just learning HTML/CSS. Semantic is a styling framework that builds upon HTML/CSS concepts. As I had just learned HTML/CSS, it was significantly harder for Semantic-UI concepts to stick.

## Learning Athletically
I find that I learn best by working through problems. The more problems I do, the more comfortable I feel with the material and the more intuitive it seems; however, there does seem to be a problem with just solving problems and that is, learning terms and concepts. While it is true that doing problems can make some concepts easier to understand, other concepts can be completely neglected. This concept of "learning through doing," is known as athletic learning.

Recently, I interviewed to STAR at UH Manoa. STAR created, and now manages, the online registration system UH uses today. STAR has also developed several other web applications including a site for scholarships and for advising. I applied to a back-end SQL position. During the interview, I was able to complete the coding portion of the interview without any major problems; however, I struggled to answer several of the technical questions asked during the interview. Similarly, on exams and quizzes, I find solving problems easier than defining concepts.

An "athletic," problem-solving approach to learning needs to be supplmented with other resources. Additionally, one should experiment with different and new methods when solving problems. While solving problems can give you an intuitive sense of how things work, other sources are needed to put concepts into words and give these concepts names. One should compare their answers with others when completing problems. Viewing the thought process of others can open up new insights about a problem and provide new material to study and attempt to understand.

## Agile Project Management
Everything I know regarding web development has been introduced to me within this past year. Learning about agile project management methods seems to fit well with everything else I know regarding web development. Agile project development is a dynamic approach to developing software. Instead of separating design and implementation phases, agile project management combines the two. Development begins by implementing basic features, and new features are designed and implemented in parallel. This way, developers can adjust easily to the needs of a constantly changing project. Agile project development also provides a nice division of work, one example of agile development is SCRUM. SCRUM consists of a periodic cycle, containing cyclic divvying of work, individual meetings, and a project backlog of tasks. With this system, it is easy to see what individual developers are doing and how the project is progressing as a whole.

However, there are problems with agile project management. For instance, as tasks are added or removed dynamically, it can be hard to find a finishing point of a project. As the functionality for the finished project may not be well-defined, agile project management can lead to never-ending development cycles. Every week, new functionality is added, or changes to the site are requested, and the project enters a perpetual state of development. Additionally, as functionality changes, it can be hard to plan ahead. Thus, code may be written in a way that must be re-written to implement future changes. Thus, agile project management can lead to extra work and frustration.
