## Syntax
My first experience with JavaScript was through a free online course through CodeCademy. I was able to blaze through the majority of the lessons due to JavaScript having functionality and syntax similar to C++. I believe that learning new programming languages makes it easier to learn other programming languages. Along with syntax, you learn new concepts and build on existing ones. Concepts of looping, if/else logic, encapsulation, scope, object-oriented program, etc are developed when learning one language and can then be reapplied to the next. Repitition of one language can make the learning of a syntactically-similar language easier.
