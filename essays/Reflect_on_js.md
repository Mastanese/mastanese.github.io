## Syntax
I believe that learning new programming languages makes it easier to learn other programming languages. Foundations built when learning one language can be leaned on when learning another--Concepts of looping, if/else logic, encapsulation, scope, object-oriented program, etc are found in many programming languages. Similarly, syntax is often reused across languages. My first experience with JavaScript was through a free online course through CodeCademy. I was able to power through the majority of the lessons due to JavaScript having functionality and syntax similar to C++.  

## Asynchronous Functions
My first experience with asynchronous procedures was with SystemVerilog. SystemVerilog is a language used in hardware design and simulation. In SystemVerilog, values can be assigned with either a blocking (=) or a non-blocking (<=) operator. In a non-blocking assignment, variables are assigned asynchronously. In a blocking assignment, variables are assigned sequentially. 

While running sequential logic, SystemVerilog allows for the implementation of asyncrhonous components using combinational logic blocks. These blocks can change instantly while sequential outputs change only at clock changes. Similarly, JavaScript implements asynchronous, promise-based functions. I think JavaScript is an interesting language and I hope to be able to use it more often.

## Learning Through Doing
I find that I learn best by working through problems. The more problems I do, the more comfortable I feel with the material and the more intuitive it seems; however, there does seem to be a problem with just solving problems and that is, learning terms and concepts. While it is true that doing problems can make some concepts easier to understand, other concepts can be completely neglected. 

Recently, I interviewed to STAR at UH Manoa. STAR created, and now manages, the online registration system UH uses today. STAR has also developed several other web applications including a site for scholarships and for advising. I applied to a back-end SQL position. During the interview, I was able to complete the coding portion of the interview without any major problems; however, I struggled to answer several of the technical questions asked during the interview. Similarly, on exams and quizzes, I find solving problems easier than defining concepts.

An "athletic," problem-solving approach to learning needs to be supplmented with other resources. Additionally, one should experiment with different and new methods when solving problems. While solving problems can give you an intuitive sense of how things work, other sources are needed to put concepts into words and give these concepts names. One should compare their answers with others when completing problems. Viewing the thought process of others can open up new insights about a problem and provide new material to study and attempt to understand.
