## Syntax
My first experience with JavaScript was through a free online course through CodeCademy. I was able to blaze through the majority of the lessons due to JavaScript having functionality and syntax similar to C++. I believe that learning new programming languages makes it easier to learn other programming languages. Along with syntax, you learn new concepts and build on existing ones. Concepts of looping, if/else logic, encapsulation, scope, object-oriented program, etc are developed when learning one language and can then be reapplied to the next. Repitition of one language can make the learning of a syntactically-similar language easier.

## Asynchronous Functions
My first experience with asynchronous procedures was with SystemVerilog. SystemVerilog is a language used in hardware design and simulation. In SystemVerilog, values can be assigned with either a blocking (=) or a non-blocking (<=) operator. In a non-blocking assignment, variables are assigned asynchronously. In a blocking assignment, variables are assigned sequentially.

Similarly, JavaScript has promise-based, asynchronous functions. 

## Learning Through Doing
I find that I learn best by working through problems. The more problems I do, the more comfortable I feel with the material and the more intuitive it seems; however, there does seem to be a problem with just solving problems and that is, learning terms and concepts. While it is true that doing problems can make some concepts easier to understand, other concepts can be completely neglected. 

Recently, I interviewed to STAR at UH Manoa. STAR created the online registration system UH uses today as well as several other web applications including a scholarship site and advising site. I applied to a back-end SQL position. During the interview, I was able to complete the coding portion of the interview without any problems; however, I struggled to answer several of the technical questions asked during the interview. Similarly, on exams and quizzes, I find solving problems easier than defining concepts.

An "athletic," problem-solving approach to learning needs to be supplmented with other resources. Additionally, one should experiment with different and new methods when solving problems. While solving problems can give you an intuitive sense of how things work, other sources are needed to put these concepts into words and give these concepts names. Similarly, one should compare their answers with others when completing problems. Viewing the thought process of others can open up new insights about a problem and provide new material to study and attempt to understand.
