# The Etiquette of Software Engineering

## Ethics

In designing an application, many ethnical considerations need to be considered. Failures caused by poorly written code are often not as drastic or noticeable as, say, a bridge collapsing; however, the consequences of failing code can lead to equally drastic consequences. For example, in a space craft, power consumption may be controlled by code. Power management is important in space craft as they have to be completely self-sufficient and oftentimes, space or weight constraints limit the total power generation/storage of a craft. 

Power failure can lead to huge costs. One example is in CubeSats. CubeSats are small, unmanned satellites often developed by universities or other entitites who may not have the funds to build a full-fledged satellites. CubeSats are very small, with the smallest having dimensions of 10cm x 10cm x 10cm. Many CubeSats have what is known as a critical power level, in which the CubeSat has to stay above to remain functional. Dropping below this power level can lead to an unrecoverable loss of the satellite. CubeSat development often takes many years and launch and development costs can be in the millions of dollars. Losing a satellite before its mission is over understandably leads to huge losses to stakeholders.

Ethical considerations in software development means creating the best product for the clients of the product. The clients include everyone involved in the project--from the project creators to the project consumers. This means creating high-quality code which maintains functionality while conforming to laws, regulations, and moral responsibilities.

## Case Study - The code I'm still ashamed of

We will now be looking at a case study written by [Bill Sournour](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e/#.tsjl7lkxy) on developing code for a marketing company. The code was made to market a specific pharmacuteutical drug and its target demographic was teenage girls; however, the site posed as a general quizzing site rather than being transparent about its true goal--marketing the drug. 

The specific drug was linked to depression and there were multiple suicide cases in which the victim had been taking the drug marketed by the company. Additionally, the sister of the developer was also recommended to take this drug. Thus, the developer had created a website which had a couple of ethical concerns:

1. The drug was a factor in several suicide cases
2. The website misled visitors, not making clear that it was a marketing site

The developer did not create or sell the drug, thus, he was not directly responsible for any of the suicides which may have been caused by the drug. Additionally, the website was not created with any malicious intent, the developer just did what he was paid to do.

However, the website could have led to more people trying the drug, this could have also lead to more suicides. However, it is also possible that this drug was beneficial to many other people, and the website did more good than bad. Its also likely that if this developer did not create the site, the company would have contracted someone else to create the site. By refusing to create the site, the developer could have suffered consequences for no benefit (the site would be created by someone else). Thus, whether creating this site was an ethical is a gray area.
