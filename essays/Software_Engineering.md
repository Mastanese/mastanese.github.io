Growing up, I have always wanted to become an engineer. I did not know what kind, or even what an engineer did--I just knew that I enjoyed math and physics and that engineers got paid well. Enrolling at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa, I decided to major in Electrical Engineering. 

At UH, I had fun taking my computer-related classes--from EE 160 (C Programming for Engineers), to EE 260 (Introduction to Digital Design), and to my sophomore project working with Python and Arduinos, I enjoyed both the hardware and software aspect of computers. Eventually, I decided to switch to Computer Engineering, a major offered jointly by the EE and ICS departments at UH Manoa.
