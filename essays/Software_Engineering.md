Growing up, I had always wanted to become an engineer. I did not know what kind, or even what an engineer did--I just enjoyed math and physics and knew that engineers made lots of money. Enrolling at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa, I decided to major in Electrical Engineering. 

At UH, I had fun taking my computer-related classes--from EE 160 (C Programming for Engineers), to EE 260 (Introduction to Digital Design), and to my sophomore project working with Python and Arduinos, I enjoyed both the hardware and software aspect of computers. Eventually, I decided to switch to Computer Engineering, a major offered jointly by the EE and ICS departments at UH Manoa.

Along with learning more about hardware, I would also like to further develop my knowledge in software development. I want to create clean-looking webapps with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS; I want to learn about machine learning and data science. I would like to learn the in-and-outs of SQL to create an efficient database. I would like to learn about the integration of hardware and software in IoT. The field of software engineering is vast and I would like to learn as much as I can. It would also be nice benefit to make money doing so.
