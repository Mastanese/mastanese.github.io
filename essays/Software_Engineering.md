Growing up, I had always wanted to become an engineer. I did not know what kind, or even what an engineer did--I just enjoyed math and physics and knew that engineers made lots of money. Thus, enrolling at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa, I decided to major in Electrical Engineering. 

At UH, I had fun taking my computer-related classes--from EE 160 (C Programming for Engineers), to EE 260 (Introduction to Digital Design), and to my sophomore project working with Python and Arduinos, I enjoyed both the hardware and software aspect of computers. So, it was no surprise that I switched to Computer Engineering at the end of my sophomore year. At UH Manoa, Computer Engineering (CENG) is a major offered jointly by the EE and ICS departments at UH Manoa. Through the rest of my time at UH, I hope to learn a lot more and gain more experience in the field of computers.

Along with learning more about hardware, I would also like to further develop my knowledge in software development. I want to create clean-looking webapps with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, learn about machine learning and data science; I would like to learn the in-and-outs of SQL to be able to create and manage an efficient database. I would like to learn about the integration of hardware and software in IoT and learn about cyber and network security. The field of software engineering is vast and I would like to learn and experience as much as I can. Someday, I also hope to make lots of money.
